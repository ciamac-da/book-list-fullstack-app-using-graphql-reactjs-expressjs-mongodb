# Note: I've used MongoDB Compass Offline Database for this project!
# How to start MongoDB Compass after you already installed it? 
1. Open up your Terminal and type this command there ==> systemctl start mongod
2. Check if it works using ==> systemctl status mongod
3. If you got Active : 🟢 active means server is running
4. Now open MongoDB Compass App and click on conncet button to see the database! 😎


# Go to the server folder and install the Dependencies using ==> npm install


# Type node/nodemon app in terminal to start the process ==> 
 Now listening for requests on port 4000

# Now you can type http://localhost:4000/graphql in browser and get access to GraphiQL sandbox!
 GraphiQL is an in-browser tool for writing, validating, and testing GraphQL queries.
